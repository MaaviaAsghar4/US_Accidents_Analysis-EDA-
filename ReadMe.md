# US Accidents Analysis 2020
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents

The analysis has been carried out with only 1% of the original data due to extensively large number of records. 

However, from this 1% data following conclusion has been derived;
- California and Florida are the two states where accidents occur in large numbers. This might be due to large population and coastal areas present in these states.
- There are two peak times where accidents mostly occur. These include time between 6-9 am and 3-6 pm, which is mainly due to people going and coming from their offices.
- The other unusual insight from the analysis is that accidents mostly occur in clear weather rather than rainy or cloudy weather.
- Traffic signal is the top factor that affects the number of accidents and its severity.


## For future analysis, following steps could be taken to gain more insights from the data,
- Larger sample size of the data.
- City wise accident analysis.
- Day wise accident analysis.
